## Bower dependencies

In this task, you have to deal with package conflicts.
This app uses AngularJS, AngularUI, typeahead.js, fuelux and Angular-Bootstrap. Those libraries have transitive dependencies that may conflict with each other.

###Goal
Modify **bower.json** file so that next `bower install` does not ask any question and app works properly
When dependency conflicts are resolved correctly, you should see properly working Typeahead, Checkbox - fluent and Checkbox with buttons.

###Before you start, read about
