The world need more heroes. You are given a hard task to create at least two heroes and one superhero. Implement three simple directives that will
allow you to create as many heroes as you need.

* ***mask*** directive restricted as element and with given template as follows: *```<img src="assets/mask.png" class="mask-position" width="62px">```*
* ***superhero*** directive restricted as element with template that use previous directives  - you should put mask after the hero element (use directives inside template *```<div class="relative-position">....</div>```* 
* Directives used in correct places at **index.html** (check comments)
