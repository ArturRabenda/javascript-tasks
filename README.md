#Exercise 5 : Angular filters

##Summary
In this application, you are supposed to create three simple filters and use them in right places.

##Goals
1. `quote` filter - wraps the text with quotes
2. `withoutH` filter - removes all the letters H and h
3. `firstLetterUp` filter - converts the first letter of the word to the large ones (take a look at regular expression)

Additionaly, you are supposed to use build-in angular filter to display upper input value capitalised below the table.

| Filter | Without filter | With filter |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| quote  | To be, or not to be...| "To be, or not to be..." |
| withoutH  | The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies   | Te obbit: Te Battle of te Five Armies |
|firstLetterUp|Visit BBC News for up-to-the-minute news, breaking news, video, audio and stories. |Visit Bbc News For Up-To-The-Minute News, Breaking News, Video, Audio And Stories|
